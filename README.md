# AME-SRE

Every thing started form the trip to find the authorization code
By reading of "Hacker Disassembling Uncovered by Kris Kaspersky (ed) ISBN:1931769222", I start to discover the code of ame.exp in AME 2.1 for AutoCAD Release 12.

First of all, you will need the softwares or tools as listed below:
1. Oracle VM VirtualBox with debugger enabled.
1. IDA pro.
1. Hacker's view.
1. Pharlap 386 Dos extender 4.1.

In the Oracle VM VirtualBox, I built a VM with:
  1. DOS 6.22, AutoCAD R12 with AME 2.1;
  1. MASM 6.1;
  1. Hacker's view.;
  1. Pharlap 386 Dos extender 4.1;
  1. Metaware High C 386;

To excute the task of finding authorization code, I have learned or tried:
  1. x86 Assembly language with DOS and BIOS call.
  1. AutoCAD Developement System (ADS) in Metaware High C language.
  1. IDA Pro.
  1. Oracle VM VirtualBox debugger.
